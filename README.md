# Bad Joke Generator-Client

This application is designed for a user to create an account, granting them access to a database filled with bad jokes of all varieties. User's are able to create jokes of their own, which are then able to be updated and deleted by their owner. The Bad Joke Generator is perfect for breaking the ice during many of life's uncomfortable social situations.

### Planning Story

While building this application, I stuck very closely to the suggested schedule outline provided to us. In my previous project, I was very inefficient on day one, trying to begin writing code but becoming overwhelmed by the scope of the project. Having direction from the beginning made a huge difference, providing a starting point and a tangible task to begin with. I began by setting up front-end and back-end repositories, built my API, built CRUD functionality for client-side, and finished with documentation and styling.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to sign-up/sign-in.
* As a user, I want to be able to see all jokes.
* As a user, I want to be able to create a joke.
* As a user, I want to be able to update a joke.
* As a user, I want to be able to delete a joke.

### Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Handlebars
* jQuery
* Javascript

### Unsolved Problems

* I would like to only display the punchline on a click event.
* I would like to add a joke of the day that displays automatically before showing other jokes.
* I would like to continue styling.
